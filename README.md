• Performed exploratory data analysis to identify trends in customer feedback for various airlines. <br>
• Preprocessed text data (removed URLs, special characters, converted text to lowercase). <br>
• Fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model to achieve a sentiment classification. <br>
• Addressed challenges related to class imbalance and model overfitting. <br>

## Project 5: Data-Driven Product Management Conducting a Market Analysis (DataCamp Project)
Conducted market analysis using data manipulation techniques in python to examine trends in online interest for fitness products and developed visualizations to inform strategic product decisions and drive market expansion.

## Project 4: Visualizing the History of Nobel Prize Winners (DataCamp Project)
